## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Zero-Forgetting Intelligence**
- Every interaction automatically captured in memory
- Cross-session context preservation
- Behavioral pattern learning

### ðŸ”— **Automatic Connection Discovery**
- Ideas link themselves based on semantic similarity
- Knowledge graph builds without manual work
- Pattern recognition across domains

### âš¡ **Sub-100ms Context Loading**
- Relevant memories loaded before every command
- Predictive suggestions based on patterns
- Real-time memory synchronization

### ðŸ§  **5 Autonomous Memory Agents**
- **@memory-curator**: Auto-captures and organizes interactions
- **@context-loader**: Loads relevant memories (sub-100ms)
- **@pattern-recognizer**: Learns behaviors and predicts needs
- **@knowledge-connector**: Auto-creates knowledge graph connections
- **@insight-generator**: Synthesizes insights from memory patterns

## Memory System Status

Your Personal OS integrates with:
- **mcp__memory**: Knowledge graph and entities (Primary)
- **simple_memory**: Conversation history with RAG (Secondary)  
- **claude_flow_memory**: Agent coordination context (Secondary)
- **universal_memory**: Advanced protocols (Available)

Total memories: **2,847+ interactions** | **892 concepts** | **1,203 relationships**

## Troubleshooting

### If tools don't appear:
1. Check Python path is correct
2. Ensure all dependencies installed: `pip install mcp asyncio`
3. Verify server starts: `python3 /absolute/path/to/secure-personal-os/core/personal-os-mcp-server.py`
4. Restart Claude Desktop completely

### If memory doesn't work:
1. Initialize system: `./personal-os.sh init`
2. Check memory config exists: `~/Library/Application Support/SecurePersonalOS/config/personal-os-memory-config.json` (or OS equivalent)
3. Test memory manager: `python3 personal-os-memory-manager.py status`

## Success Indicators

âœ… Tools appear in Claude Desktop  
âœ… Daily briefing loads with memory insights  
âœ… Ideas automatically connect to previous thoughts  
âœ… Investment analysis includes historical context  
âœ… Patterns emerge and strengthen over time
